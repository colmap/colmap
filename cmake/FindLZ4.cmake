# Find package module for LZ4 library.
#
# The following variables are set by this module:
#
#   LZ4_FOUND: TRUE if LZ4 is found.
#   LZ4_INCLUDE_DIRS: Include directories for LZ4.
#   LZ4_LIBRARIES: Libraries required to link LZ4.
#
# The following variables control the behavior of this module:
#
# LZ4_INCLUDE_DIR_HINTS: List of additional directories in which to
#                              search for LZ4 includes.
# LZ4_LIBRARY_DIR_HINTS: List of additional directories in which to
#                              search for LZ4 libraries.
