# Find package module for FLANN library.
#
# The following variables are set by this module:
#
#   FLANN_FOUND: TRUE if FLANN is found.
#   FLANN_INCLUDE_DIRS: Include directories for FLANN.
#   FLANN_LIBRARIES: Libraries required to link FLANN.
#
# The following variables control the behavior of this module:
#
# FLANN_INCLUDE_DIR_HINTS: List of additional directories in which to
#                              search for FLANN includes.
# FLANN_LIBRARY_DIR_HINTS: List of additional directories in which to
#                              search for FLANN libraries.
