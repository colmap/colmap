# Find package module for Metis library.

#
#   METIS_FOUND: TRUE if Metis is found.
#   METIS_INCLUDE_DIRS: Include directories for Metis.
#   METIS_LIBRARIES: Libraries required to link Metis.

# METIS_INCLUDE_DIR_HINTS: List of additional directories in which to
#                              search for Metis includes.
# METIS_LIBRARY_DIR_HINTS: List of additional directories in which to
#                              search for Metis libraries.
