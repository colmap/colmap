About
-----

COLMAP is a general-purpose Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo
(MVS) pipeline with a graphical and command-line interface. It offers a wide
range of features for reconstruction of ordered and unordered image collections.

Download
--------

Executables and other resources can be downloaded from https://demuc.de/colmap/.


Getting Started
---------------

1. Download the `pre-built binaries <https://demuc.de/colmap/>`_ or build the
   library manually from `source <https://github.com/colmap/colmap>`_
   (see :ref:`Installation <installation>`).
2. Download one of the provided datasets (see :ref:`Datasets <datasets>`)
   or use your own images.
3. Use the **automatic reconstruction** to easily build models
   with a single click (see :ref:`Quickstart <quick-start>`).
4. Watch the short introductory video at
   `YouTube <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-EC0DzeVEU>`_ or read the
   :ref:`Tutorial <tutorial>` for more details.
