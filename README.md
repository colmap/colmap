Getting Started
---------------

1. Download the pre-built binaries from
   https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B_oNOlzQHU_Ha2hkdlRQYzQ4RDA#list
   or build the library manually as described in the documentation.
2. Watch the short introductory video at
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-EC0DzeVEU or read the tutorial
   in the documentation for more details.

should be submitted in the form of new issues and/or pull requests on GitHub.

Please, adhere to the Google coding style guide:

    http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.html

by using the provided ".clang-format" file.

Document functions, methods, classes, etc. with inline documentation strings
describing the API, using the following format:

    // Short description.
    //
    // Longer description with a few sentences and multiple lines.
    //
    // @param parameter1            Description for parameter 1.
    // @param parameter2            Description for parameter 2.
    //
    // @return                      Description of optional return value.

Add unit tests for all newly added code and make sure that algorithmic
"improvements" generalize and actually improve the results of the pipeline on a
variety of datasets.
