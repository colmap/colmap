About
-----

COLMAP is a general-purpose Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo
(MVS) pipeline with a graphical and command-line interface. It offers a wide
range of features for reconstruction of ordered and unordered image collections.

builds on top of existing works and when using specific algorithms within
COLMAP, please also cite the original authors, as specified in the source code.


Download
--------

Executables for Windows and Mac and other resources can be downloaded from
https://demuc.de/colmap/. Executables for Linux/Unix/BSD are available at
https://repology.org/metapackage/colmap/versions. To build COLMAP from source,
please see https://colmap.github.io/install.html.

Getting Started
---------------

1. Download the pre-built binaries from https://demuc.de/colmap/ or build the
   library manually as described in the documentation.
2. Download one of the provided datasets at https://demuc.de/colmap/datasets/
   or use your own images.
3. Use the **automatic reconstruction** to easily build models
   with a single click or command.
4. Watch the short introductory video at
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-EC0DzeVEU or read the tutorial
   in the documentation at https://colmap.github.io/ for more details.
