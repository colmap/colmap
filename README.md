About
-----

COLMAP is a general-purpose Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo
(MVS) pipeline with a graphical and command-line interface. It offers a wide
range of features for reconstruction of ordered and unordered image collections.

Acknowledgments
---------------

COLMAP was originally written by [Johannes Sch√∂nberger](https://demuc.de/) with
funding provided by his PhD advisors Jan-Michael Frahm and Marc Pollefeys.

The Python bindings in PyCOLMAP were originally added by
[Mihai Dusmanu](https://github.com/mihaidusmanu),
[Philipp Lindenberger](https://github.com/Phil26AT), and
[Paul-Edouard Sarlin](https://github.com/Skydes).

The project has also benefitted from countless community contributions, including
bug fixes, improvements, new features, third-party tooling, and community
support (special credits to [Torsten Sattler](https://tsattler.github.io)).


Contribution
------------

Contributions (bug reports, bug fixes, improvements, etc.) are very welcome and
should be submitted in the form of new issues and/or pull requests on GitHub.
