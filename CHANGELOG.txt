COLMAP 3.1 (6/15/2017)
----------------------
- Add fast spatial verification to image retrieval module
- Add binary file format for sparse models by default. Old text format still
  fully compatible and possible conversion in GUI and CLI
- Add cross-platform little endian binary file reading and writing
- Faster and less memory hungry stereo fusion by computing consistency on demand
  and possible limitation of image size in fusion
- Simpler geometric stereo processing interface.
  Now geometric stereo output can be computed using a single pass
- Faster and multi-architecture CUDA compilation
- Add medium quality option in automatic reconstructor
- Many more bug fixes and improvements


COLMAP 3.0 (5/22/2017)
----------------------
- Add automatic end-to-end reconstruction tool that automatically performs
  sparse and dense reconstruction on a given set of images
- Add multi-GPU dense stereo if multiple CUDA devices are available
- Add multi-GPU feature matching if multiple CUDA devices are available
- Add Manhattan-world / gravity alignment using line detection
- Add CUDA-based feature extraction useful for usage on clusters
- Add CPU-based feature matching for machines without GPU
- Add new THIN_PRISM_FISHEYE camera model with tangential/radial correction
- Add binary to triangulate existing/empty sparse reconstruction
- Add binary to print summary statistics about sparse reconstruction
- Add transitive feature matching to transitively complete match graph
- Improved scalability of dense reconstruction by using caching
- More stable GPU-based feature matching with informative warnings
- Faster vocabulary tree matching using dynamic scheduling in FLANN
- Faster spatial feature matching using linear index instead of kd-tree
- More stable camera undistortion using numerical Newton iteration
- Improved option parsing with some backwards incompatible option renaming
- Faster compile times by optimizing includes and CUDA flags
- More stable view selection for small baseline scenario in dense reconstruction
- Many more bug fixes and improvements

- Various bug fixes and performance improvements


COLMAP 1.1 (5/19/2016)
----------------------
- Implementation of state-of-the-art image retrieval system using Hamming
  embedding for vocabulary tree matching. This should lead to much improved
  matching results as compared to the previous implementation.
- Guided matching as an optional functionality.
- New demo datasets for download.
- Automatically switch to PBA if supported by the project.
