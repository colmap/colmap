COLMAP 3.5 (08/22/2018)
-----------------------
- COLMAP is now released under the BSD license instead of the GPL
- COLMAP is now installed as a library, whose headers can be included and
  libraries linked against from other C/C++ code
- Add hierarchical mapper for parallelized reconstruction or large scenes
- Add sparse and dense Delaunay meshing algorithms, which reconstruct a
  watertight surface using a graph cut on the Delaunay triangulation of the
  reconstructed sparse or dense point cloud
- Improved robustness when merging different models
- Improved pre-trained vocabulary trees available for download
- Add COLMAP as a software entry under Linux desktop systems

COLMAP 3.4 (01/29/2018)
-----------------------
- Unified command-line interface: The functionality of previous executables have
  been merged into the ``src/exe/colmap.cc`` executable. The GUI can now be
  started using the command ``colmap gui`` and other commands are available
  as ``colmap [command]``. For example, the feature extractor is now available
  as ``colmap feature_extractor [args]`` while all command-line arguments stay
  the same as before. This should result in much faster project compile times
  and smaller disk space usage of the program. More details about the new
  interface are documented at https://colmap.github.io/cli.html
- More complete depth and normal maps with larger patch sizes
- Faster dense stereo computation by skipping rows/columns in patch match,
  improved random sampling in patch match, and faster bilateral NCC
- Better high DPI screen support for the graphical user interface
- Improved model viewer under Windows, which now requires Qt 5.4
- Save computed two-view geometries in database
- Images (keypoint/matches visualization, depth and normal maps) can now be
  saved from the graphical user interface
- Support for PMVS format without sparse bundler file
- Faster covariant feature detection
- Many more bug fixes and improvements
