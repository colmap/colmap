COLMAP 3.6 (07/24/2020)
-----------------------
- Improved robustness and faster incremental reconstruction process
- Add ``image_deleter`` command to remove images from sparse model
- Add ``image_filter`` command to filter bad registrations from sparse model
- Add ``point_filtering`` command to filter sparse model point clouds
- Add ``database_merger`` command to merge two databases, which is
  useful to parallelize matching across different machines

  without a pre-existing full sparse model
- Improved undistortion for fisheye cameras and FOV camera model
- Support for masking input images in feature extraction stage
- Improved HiDPI support in GUI for high-resolution monitors
- Import sparse model when launching GUI from CLI

- COLMAP is now installed as a library, whose headers can be included and
  libraries linked against from other C/C++ code
- Add hierarchical mapper for parallelized reconstruction or large scenes
- Add sparse and dense Delaunay meshing algorithms, which reconstruct a
  watertight surface using a graph cut on the Delaunay triangulation of the
  reconstructed sparse or dense point cloud
- Improved robustness when merging different models
- Improved pre-trained vocabulary trees available for download
- Add COLMAP as a software entry under Linux desktop systems

  started using the command ``colmap gui`` and other commands are available
  as ``colmap [command]``. For example, the feature extractor is now available
  as ``colmap feature_extractor [args]`` while all command-line arguments stay
  the same as before. This should result in much faster project compile times
  and smaller disk space usage of the program. More details about the new
  interface are documented at https://colmap.github.io/cli.html
